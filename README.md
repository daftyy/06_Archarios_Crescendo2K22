# **ROUTE FINDR**
*Problem from the Crescendo 2022 hackathon*

## **Objectives**   
* To create a tool which can generate and communicate optimal routing plans to help reduce costs and environmental impact.   
* To minimize transportation costs by optimizing the route of vehicles from a single source to multiple destinations.   
* To generate savings by determining the lowest-cost carrier and route for every shipment, for every mode, all across the globe. 
* To assign “Green Score” to help track carbon footprint and sustainability. 
* To save fuel and cost by efficient carrier planning using the shortest routes and cheaper modes of transport. This gives us a better "Green Score" and is better for the environment.
